ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jarwati from Nganjuk Jawa Timur. I can easily adabt to new situation and environment. I do well on managing, computing, analysing and also teamwork. Iâ€™m interested in Quality assurance and i have more than 2 years experience in manual testingsoftware. I also enjoy to analyst system requirement to create test plan, test scenario and test cases, and also create automation script. I do well on system testing and regression testing. Now, I'm interested in learning more deeply about Quality Assurance automation such as selenium webdriver with python and pytest framework and update my skill to make a better system with minimum bugs and defect. Being a QA is not only about finding bugs but also knowing how to do bug management. You can checkout my test case and my automation code
